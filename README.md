# Skill Swap

Skill Swap is built around the idea of networking through skill exchange, directly aligning with the theme by fostering meaningful connections between users based on shared learning goals. Instead of traditional one-way mentorship, users form mutually beneficial partnerships where they both teach and learn â€” creating a collaborative network that mirrors real-world professional upskilling and peer mentorship.

The platform not only promotes collaboration and communication, but also reflects the spirit of community-driven growth, which is essential in any networking environment.
